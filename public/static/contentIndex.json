I bring the experience, you keep the equity.\n\n\nFull Operational Overhaul\nFrom SOPs to staff roles, we’ll streamline and reorganize so the business runs like it should — without you doing everything.\n\n\nIT &amp; Infrastructure\nTech audits, system upgrades, security protocols — you’ll finally know what you own, how it works, and that it’s not bleeding money.\n\n\nReal-Time Command Center\nDashboards, live reporting, and key metrics in one place so you can make decisions without guessing.\n\n\nBottom line: I don’t just give advice — I build the systems, implement the tools, and make sure they work in the real world."},"01-scope/E-What-I-DON-T-Do/index":{"slug":"01-scope/E-What-I-DON-T-Do/index","filePath":"01-scope/E-What-I-DON-T-Do/index.md","title":"index","links":["01-scope/E-What-I-DON-T-Do","01-scope/A-Your-Details","01-scope/B-QiSuiteTM-Overview","01-scope/C-Scope-of-Services","01-scope/D-What-I-Do","01-scope/F-What-I-Expect-From-You","01-scope/G-KPIs-Goals","01-scope/H-Case-Studies--and--Wins","02-investment/A-Investment-Payment-Terms","02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example","03-roadmap-strategies-faqs/A-Roadmap","03-roadmap-strategies-faqs/B-Strategies","03-roadmap-strategies-faqs/C-FAQs","05-agreement/A.-Agreement-Sections","07-financials/A-Assets/assets","07-financials/B-Banks/banking","07-financials/C-Contractors/payroll-contractors","07-financials/D-Liability/loans-n-credit","07-financials/E-Expenses/expenses","07-financials/F-Entity-Docs/entity-docs","07-financials/I-Insurance/insurance","07-financials/O-Others/other-deductions","07-financials/R-Reports/reports","07-financials/T-Taxes/taxes","08-marketing/A-Brand-Assets/logos-and-assets","08-marketing/B-Sales-Materials/sales-materials","08-marketing/D-Decks/brochures-and-decks","08-marketing/E-Testimonials/testimonials","08-marketing/F-Websites/website-and-socials","08-marketing/marketing-overview","09-operations/A-Sops/sample-sop","09-operations/A-Sops/standard-ops","09-operations/C-Vendors/vendors-list","09-operations/operations-overview","10-technology/A-Architecture/cfo-os-technical-architecture","10-technology/B-Development/integrations","10-technology/B-Development/web-deployment-readme","10-technology/C-Chatbot/chatbot-readme","10-technology/D-Docs/client-installation-guide","10-technology/D-Docs/deployment-checklist","10-technology/D-Docs/licenses-and-keys","10-technology/E-Tech-Stack/technology","10-technology/E-Tech-Stack/tools-stack","11-legal-compliance/legal-compliance","12-human-resources/hr-overview","12-human-resources/policies-and-handbooks","12-human-resources/team-directory","13-engagements/engagements","14-analytics/A-Work-Summaries/2025-08-09-BuiltByRays-Launch-Day-Work-Log--and--ROI-Final","99-archives/archives-overview","/","tags/What-I-Dont-Do"],"tags":["What-I-Dont-Do"],"content":"\ntitle: D.

My brain needs rest to keep producing high-level results.\n\n\nPretend to be a CPA.\nIf it legally requires a CPA or attorney, I’ll hand it to one — with your paperwork already clean and ready.\n\n\nSmile and nod at bad ideas.\nIf you’re about to set money on fire, I’ll tell you straight.\n\n\nAct like an order taker.\nI’m not your errand runner.

Period.\n\n\n🛡️ The Buffer Deposit\n\nOne Month Retainer as Buffer: This protects us both.\nExample: If your weekly is $250:\n\nFirst payment = $1,250\n\n$1,000 = Non-refundable buffer deposit\n$250 = Your first week of service\n\n\n\n\nThe buffer stays in place during our engagement.\nIf you cancel or ghost, that deposit covers the fallout — non-refundable.\n\n\n📈 Percentage of Gross Income\nOn top of your retainer:\n\nI receive a 2.0% of your gross revenue for acting as your Virtual C-Suite.\nWhy gross, not net? Because I’m here to help you grow, not get stuck in your expense drama.\nThis percentage is based on an estimated annual gross income agreed upon at onboarding.\n\n\n🔍 Audit &amp; Adjustment Process (Like Insurance, But Prettier)\n\nEstimate\n\nWe agree on an estimated annual gross at the start.\nPercentage is applied weekly to that estimate.\n\n\nTrack\n\nYou provide ongoing access to revenue reports so I can keep an eye on trends.\n\n\nAudit\n\nQuarterly or annually, we compare your actual gross to the estimate.\n\n\nTrue-Up\n\nIf you made more than projected → you owe the difference.\nIf you made less than projected → you get a credit or reduced rate moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n📊 Peak &amp; Valley Payment Smoothing\nBusiness is seasonal — I get it.\n\nWhen you’re slammed and revenue’s up, payments inflate so I share in the busy grind.\nWhen things slow down, payments deflate to ease the pressure on your cash flow.\nYour payment schedule will reflect these natural cycles, so you’re never overpaying in a drought or underpaying in a boom.\nThis keeps us both sustainable, sane, and on the same side.\n\n\n🎯 Bonus Structure — How I Win When You Win\n\nBonuses are triggered when you hit or exceed growth targets set in your KPIs.\nThese are stackable — meaning the more targets you smash, the more I collect.\nTypical triggers:\n\nRevenue Milestones — e.g., every 50k or 100k in gross revenue growth.\nProfit Margin Improvements — when efficiency jumps and waste drops.\nOperational Wins — like cutting your overdue A/R in half or slashing payroll leakage.\n\n\nBonuses are calculated quarterly and billed separately from your weekly autopay.\nThink of it as my “performance tip jar” — except you already know I earned it.\n\n\n💡 My ROI Promise\nOne of my primary goals:\nThe savings I bring + the costs I prevent should outweigh what you pay me.\nThat means:\n\nI’m not just paying for myself —\nI’m actively putting extra back in your pocket.\nWhen you factor in avoided risks, increased efficiency, and profit growth, my work should feel less like an expense and more like a money-printing machine.\n\nIf at any point that balance tips the wrong way, we review, adjust, and fix it — fast.\n\n🕒 Payment Schedule\n\nAutopay runs every Monday.\nBills for billable costs are added to that week’s payment.\nNo pay, no play — I don’t start work without a clear runway.\n\n\n🚫 Late or Missed Payments\n\n48-hour grace period before work is paused.\nLate payments may incur a reactivation fee.\nChronic late payers get a breakup letter.\n\n\nBottom line: This setup means when you win, I win.\nI’m not just clocking hours — I’m invested in your bottom line like it’s my own."},"02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example/index":{"slug":"02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example/index","filePath":"02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example/index.md","title":"index","links":["02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example","01-scope/A-Your-Details","01-scope/B-QiSuiteTM-Overview","01-scope/C-Scope-of-Services","01-scope/D-What-I-Do","01-scope/E-What-I-DON-T-Do","01-scope/F-What-I-Expect-From-You","01-scope/G-KPIs-Goals","01-scope/H-Case-Studies--and--Wins","02-investment/A-Investment-Payment-Terms","03-roadmap-strategies-faqs/A-Roadmap","03-roadmap-strategies-faqs/B-Strategies","03-roadmap-strategies-faqs/C-FAQs","05-agreement/A.-Agreement-Sections","07-financials/A-Assets/assets","07-financials/B-Banks/banking","07-financials/C-Contractors/payroll-contractors","07-financials/D-Liability/loans-n-credit","07-financials/E-Expenses/expenses","07-financials/F-Entity-Docs/entity-docs","07-financials/I-Insurance/insurance","07-financials/O-Others/other-deductions","07-financials/R-Reports/reports","07-financials/T-Taxes/taxes","08-marketing/A-Brand-Assets/logos-and-assets","08-marketing/B-Sales-Materials/sales-materials","08-marketing/D-Decks/brochures-and-decks","08-marketing/E-Testimonials/testimonials","08-marketing/F-Websites/website-and-socials","08-marketing/marketing-overview","09-operations/A-Sops/sample-sop","09-operations/A-Sops/standard-ops","09-operations/C-Vendors/vendors-list","09-operations/operations-overview","10-technology/A-Architecture/cfo-os-technical-architecture","10-technology/B-Development/integrations","10-technology/B-Development/web-deployment-readme","10-technology/C-Chatbot/chatbot-readme","10-technology/D-Docs/client-installation-guide","10-technology/D-Docs/deployment-checklist","10-technology/D-Docs/licenses-and-keys","10-technology/E-Tech-Stack/technology","10-technology/E-Tech-Stack/tools-stack","11-legal-compliance/legal-compliance","12-human-resources/hr-overview","12-human-resources/policies-and-handbooks","12-human-resources/team-directory","13-engagements/engagements","14-analytics/A-Work-Summaries/2025-08-09-BuiltByRays-Launch-Day-Work-Log--and--ROI-Final","99-archives/archives-overview","/"],"tags":[],"content":"\ntitle: 💰 Investment Structure\r\ndate: 2025-08-10\r\ntags: [investment, roi-payment-projection-example, -accounts, hr, payroll]\n💰 Investment Structure\n\nContents\n\nB-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example\n\n\n\nRelated\nBacklinks\n\nA-Your-Details\nB-QiSuiteTM-Overview\nC-Scope-of-Services\nD-What-I-Do\nE-What-I-DON-T-Do\nF-What-I-Expect-From-You\nG-KPIs-Goals\nH-Case Studies &amp;
