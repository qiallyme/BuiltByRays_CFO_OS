See C-Scope-of-Services.\nRefunds / Early Termination\n\nRetainers &amp; sprint fees are non-refundable once a period starts.\nIf you terminate per A. Agreement Sections, unused future periods are not billed.\n\nAdministration\n\nBilling contact: Name • Email\nAP portal: Link / process\nPO or Job # (if required): ______\n\nPayment &amp; Terms\n\nPayment due: Net 7 (weekly plans are collected each Friday).\nPayment methods: ACH preferred; card available.\nLate: 1.5%/mo after 10 days past due.\nCancellation: Retainers are month-to-month; sprints/fixed-bids follow the milestone schedule.\nScheduling: Sprints are reserved once paid (first-come, first-served).\n\nWhich option should I pick?\n\nRetainer if you want steady momentum and a standing lane for small asks.\nSprint if you want a fast, high-impact push with clear deliverables.\nFixed-Bid if your scope won’t move and you want a single number.\n\n\nNot sure?

This may change as stack evolves (we’ll note changes in the monthly plan).\n\n\nPerformance share (baseline 3%)\nA share of monthly revenue (baseline 3%; some scenarios model a 5% stretch for planning). We use actual revenue at true-up time.\n\n\nBonus for measurable savings/KPIs (budgeted at 15%)\nWe budget 15% of estimated annual savings as a yearly bonus pool and spread it evenly across months by seasonality. At quarterly true-ups, we reconcile to actual savings/KPI wins.\n\n\nWeekly smoothing\n\nWe convert each monthly total into a weekly amount (defaults to 4.333 weeks/month) so payments are even.\nIf a true-up says we collected too much, future weeks go down; if we under-collected, future weeks go up.\n\nQuarterly true-up (every 3 months)\n\nCompare Plan vs. Actuals for Retainer (no change), Tools (actual), Revenue Share (actual % × actual revenue), Bonus (based on realized savings/KPIs).\nCompute the Quarter Delta (positive = you owe more; negative = credit).\nSpread that delta across future months by seasonality and add to weekly amounts (keeps cash-flow friendly).\n\n18-month rolling window\n\nWe plan on an 18-month horizon. Each quarter, we rebalance the remaining weeks so the plan stays aligned with reality.\n\nExample numbers &amp; spreadsheet\n\nSee B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example for a worked example.\nWe maintain a live spreadsheet (schedule + true-up). Ask us to share or embed it in your client hub.\n\nFAQs\nDo payments spike in busy months?\nNo—busy months influence the plan, but we smooth to weekly. True-ups use seasonality to distribute deltas gently.\nWhat if revenue drops?\nQuarterly, the plan re-balances automatically. You’ll see smaller weekly amounts if actuals trail plan, and vice-versa.\nCan we cap the revenue share?\nYes, we can set a cap (e.g., 5%)—noted in your plan and applied in true-ups.\nCan we change the tool budget?\nYes, we’ll document stack changes and reflect them in the next cycle."},"02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example/B-ROI-and-Payment-Projection-Example":{"slug":"02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example/B-ROI-and-Payment-Projection-Example","filePath":"02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example/B-ROI-and-Payment-Projection-Example.md","title":"B ROI and Payment Projection Example","links":["02-investment/A-Investment-Payment-Terms/A-Investment-and-Payment-Terms","02-investment/A-Investment-Payment-Terms","02-investment/B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example","14-analytics/A-Work-Summaries/2025-08-09-BuiltByRays-Launch-Day-Work-Log--and--ROI-Final","99-archives/A-qbo-backup","01-scope/A-Your-Details","01-scope/B-QiSuiteTM-Overview","01-scope/C-Scope-of-Services","01-scope/D-What-I-Do","01-scope/E-What-I-DON-T-Do","01-scope/F-What-I-Expect-From-You","01-scope/G-KPIs-Goals","01-scope/H-Case-Studies--and--Wins","/"],"tags":[],"content":"\ndate: 2025-08-14\r\ntitle: B.
