- ✅ Clear feature differentiation
- ✅ Professional pricing cards

### **Integration Requirements**

#### **Zoho Creator Integration**
```javascript
// Payment processing and client management
const zohoIntegration = {
  paymentProcessing: 'Zoho Creator Forms',
  clientDatabase: 'Zoho Creator Tables',
  agreementSigning: 'Zoho Creator Workflows',
  automatedOnboarding: 'Zoho Creator Automations'
};
```

#### **Agreement System**
- **Digital Contract Generation**: Auto-generate agreements based on selected plan
- **Electronic Signatures**: Integrate with Zoho Sign or DocuSign
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe/PayPal integration through Zoho
- **Client Portal**: Zoho Creator-based client dashboard

---

## 🤖 **Phase 3: Access & Knowledge Base**

### **AI Chatbot Integration**

#### **Technology Stack Options**

**Option 1: Ollama + Local RAG**
```python
# Local RAG implementation
import ollama
from langchain import VectorStore
from langchain.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings

class CFOAIChatbot:
    def __init__(self, client_vault_path):
        self.llm = ollama.Client()
        self.embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="llama2")
        self.vector_store = self.create_vector_store(client_vault_path)
    
    def create_vector_store(self, vault_path):
        # Index all markdown files in client's vault
        documents = self.load_vault_documents(vault_path)
        return VectorStore.from_documents(documents, self.embeddings)
    
    def answer_question(self, question, client_context):
        # RAG-based response with client-specific knowledge
        relevant_docs = self.vector_store.similarity_search(question)
        response = self.llm.generate(
            context=relevant_docs,
            question=question,
            client_context=client_context
        )
        return response
```

**Option 2: OpenAI GPT-4 + Pinecone**
```python
# Cloud-based RAG implementation
import openai
import pinecone
from langchain import OpenAI, VectorStore

class CFOAIChatbot:
    def __init__(self, client_id):
        self.openai = OpenAI(api_key="your_key")
        self.pinecone = pinecone.init(api_key="your_key")
        self.index = self.get_client_index(client_id)
    
    def get_client_index(self, client_id):
        # Get client-specific knowledge base
        return pinecone.Index(f"cfo-os-{client_id}")
```

**Option 3: Gemini + Vertex AI**
```python
# Google's enterprise solution
import vertexai
from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel

class CFOAIChatbot:
    def __init__(self, client_id):
        self.vertex = vertexai.init(project="your-project")
        self.model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("gemini-pro")
        self.knowledge_base = self.load_client_kb(client_id)
```

#### **Recommended Implementation: Hybrid Approach**
- **Primary**: Ollama for cost-effectiveness and privacy
- **Backup**: OpenAI GPT-4 for complex queries
- **Enterprise**: Gemini for large-scale deployments
