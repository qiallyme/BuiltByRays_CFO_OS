## ðŸ“Š ROI & Payment Projection (Example)

| Item                              | Amount        | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|--------------:|-------|
| **Weekly Retainer**               | $250          | Paid via autopay every Monday |
| **Monthly Buffer Deposit**        | $1,000        | Non-refundable, held as protection |
| **Estimated Annual Gross**        | $500,000      | Initial projection |
| **% of Gross Revenue**            | 5%            | Calculated weekly on estimate |
| **Weekly % Payment (Estimate)**   | $480          | ($500,000 Ã· 52) Ã— 5% |
| **Estimated Weekly Total**        | **$730**      | Retainer + % of gross |
| **Quarterly Audit Adjustment**    | Variable      | True-up based on actual gross |
| **Estimated Annual Savings**      | $40,000       | Vendor cuts, waste elimination, efficiency gains |
| **Estimated Cost Avoidance**      | $25,000       | Risk mitigation, compliance, legal avoidance |
| **Total Value Delivered**         | **$65,000**   | Savings + cost avoidance |
| **Annual Cost of Services**       | $38,000       | Retainer + % gross (based on estimate) |
| **Net ROI to Client**             | **+$27,000**  | Profit above cost of hiring me |

### ðŸ“ˆ Why This Works
- **Peaks & Valleys Adjustment:** Busier seasons = higher % payments. Slow seasons = reduced payments. Keeps cash flow friendly for both of us.
- **Quarterly True-Up:** Like an insurance premium audit â€” ensures fairness both ways.
- **Profit-Positive Goal:** My savings & cost avoidance should exceed my cost, meaning youâ€™re in profit for having me here.

> If I cost you money without making you more, Iâ€™m just an expensive hobby â€” and I donâ€™t do hobbies.
