### ðŸ“ˆ Why This Works
- **Peaks & Valleys Adjustment:** Busier seasons = higher % payments. Slow seasons = reduced payments. Keeps cash flow friendly for both of us.
- **Quarterly True-Up:** Like an insurance premium audit â€” ensures fairness both ways.
- **Profit-Positive Goal:** My savings & cost avoidance should exceed my cost, meaning youâ€™re in profit for having me here.

> If I cost you money without making you more, Iâ€™m just an expensive hobby â€” and I donâ€™t do hobbies.
