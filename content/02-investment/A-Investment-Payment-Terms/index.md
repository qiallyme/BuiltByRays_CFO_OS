These terms pair with scope in [[C-Scope-of-Services]] and deliverables in [[D-What-I-Do]]. Contract language maps to [[A. Agreement Sections]].

Here’s the simple menu we offer, so you can pick what fits your current goals and cash flow.

## Pricing Models
- **Monthly Retainer (most common):** $230.77+ / paid weekly ($3,000.00 quarterly)
- **Sprint-Based (2-week):** $3,000 - $8,500 / sprint (Hours Caps 40/50/60) 
- **Project (fixed bid):** $____ total, milestone-based

> [!tip] Choosing a model  
> Retainer = best for ongoing operating cadence.  
> Sprints = time-boxed push.  
> Project = narrowly scoped outcomes.

## 1) Ongoing: Monthly Retainer

- **$1,000 / month** (or **$230 / week** if paid weekly; $230.77 unrounded).  
- What it’s for: standing access, weekly cadence, light advisory/tasks, and continuity between pushes.  
- What’s included:
  - Priority support and a weekly check-in.
  - Up to **~6–7 advisor hours** per month for light execution/reviews.*
  - Backlog grooming and short async updates.
- Overages or larger pushes are handled via **Sprint** or **Fixed-Bid** add-ons.

> *Hours are a soft cap and meant for advisory + light execution, not full project work.

## 2) Push Work: Sprint (2 weeks)

Best when you want fast movement and clear outcomes.

- **Solo Lite Sprint** (≈40–45h): **$3,000**
- **Solo Standard Sprint** (≈50h): **$7,000**
- **Solo Intensive Sprint** (≈60h): **$8,500**

**What you get**
- Defined goals, a prioritized backlog, and daily progress.
- MVP or measurable deliverables by the end of the sprint.
- Optional handoff docs and loom walkthroughs.

**When to choose**: new system setup, migration, analytics buildout, SOP rollout, sales ops tune-up—any focused push with clear scope.

## 3) Fixed-Bid (Project)

When scope is stable and you want a single number.

- We estimate hours and risk, then quote a flat price.  
- **Typical structure**: 50% at kickoff, 25% at MVP, 25% at delivery.  
- **Change requests** are handled by written change orders (time-and-materials or a revised fixed price).

### How we calculate fixed bids (transparent method)

> Bid ≈ (Estimated Hours × **$140/hr**) × **1.20** (risk & buffer), then rounded.

**Example**: 30 hours × $140 = $4,200 × 1.20 = **$5,040** → quoted **$5,000**.

## Invoicing & Cadence
- **Retainer:** invoiced **monthly in advance** on the 1st (or start date).  
- **Sprints:** invoiced **at sprint start**.  
- **Projects:** 50% start • 30% mid • 20% delivery (unless noted otherwise).

## Payment Methods
- **ACH (preferred):** no fee.  
- **Wire:** client covers bank fees.  
- **Card:** +3.50% processing fee.  
- **Auto-pay:** enabled by default for retainers.

> [!info] Vendor setup  
> If your AP requires a vendor packet, share the form and we’ll return W-9, banking, and insurance COI if needed.

## Late, Pauses, and Reinstatement
- **Late:** > 3 days past due → work paused until paid; interest 1% / month.  
- **Planned pause:** up to 2 weeks with 30-day notice; spot on the calendar is not guaranteed without deposit.  
- **Reinstatement:** when a pause exceeds 4 weeks, a restart fee of $1000.00 may apply to reset systems and backlog.

## Expenses
- **Pre-approved, at cost** (software, data, filings, shipping).  
- We’ll confirm any expense > $100.00+ in writing.

## Credits & Discounts
- **Prepay discount:** 10% off for **quarterly** prepay.  
- **Multi-brand bundle:** 5% off per additional entity.

## Change Orders
Material changes to scope/timeline are documented in a short email or doc and approved before we proceed. See [[C-Scope-of-Services]].

## Refunds / Early Termination
- Retainers & sprint fees are **non-refundable** once a period starts.  
- If you terminate per [[A. Agreement Sections]], unused future periods are not billed.

## Administration
- **Billing contact:** Name • Email  
- **AP portal:** Link / process  
- **PO or Job #** (if required): ______

## Payment & Terms

- **Payment due**: Net 7 (weekly plans are collected each Friday).  
- **Payment methods**: ACH preferred; card available.  
- **Late**: 1.5%/mo after 10 days past due.  
- **Cancellation**: Retainers are month-to-month; sprints/fixed-bids follow the milestone schedule.  
- **Scheduling**: Sprints are reserved once paid (first-come, first-served).

## Which option should I pick?

- **Retainer** if you want steady momentum and a standing lane for small asks.  
- **Sprint** if you want a fast, high-impact push with clear deliverables.  
- **Fixed-Bid** if your scope won’t move and you want a single number.

> **Simple, aligned, and seasonal.** We keep a low, predictable base retainer that flexes with your seasonality, add a small % of revenue tied to KPIs (capped), and pay a bonus only on *tangible, proven* savings.

### 1) Seasonal Retainer (Base)
- **Monthly base:** **$1,000**  
- **Seasonality:** scales with revenue so slow months aren’t overburdened and busy months are covered.

Formula:

Seasonal Retainer = $1,000 × clamp( Monthly Revenue ÷ Annual Avg Revenue , 0.75, 1.25 )

yaml
Copy
Edit

- Minimum **$750**, maximum **$1,250**.
- **Weekly option:** **$230** (rounded) if you prefer weekly invoicing instead of monthly.

---

### 2) Performance Revenue Share (capped)
- **Up to 5%** of **recognized monthly revenue** based on KPI attainment.
- **Default projection:** 3% (example below), with a KPI ladder:

| KPI Score (met in the month) | Rev Share |
|---|---|
| 0–1 KPIs | 1% |
| 2 KPIs   | 3% |
| 3–4 KPIs | 5% (cap) |

**Core KPIs (example):**
1) Weekly dashboard delivered on time  
2) Lead-to-appointment conversion lift vs baseline  
3) Cycle-time reduction in quote→invoice or close→reconcile  
4) SOP adoption / no critical compliance misses

> We can swap KPIs to match what you track—same ladder structure.

---

### 3) Verified Savings Bonus (10–20%)
- **Bonus only on *tangible savings*** (labor hours reduced, vendor/tool spend reduced, chargebacks avoided, etc.).  
- **Rate:** **15%** (midpoint) of proven savings each month, **settled quarterly** in a true-up.
- Savings are computed from **time-tracking + invoices** vs the pre-engagement baseline.

---

### 4) Tooling Budget
- **$150/mo** for tools (automation, analytics, phone, enrichment, etc.).  
- Pass-through at cost; we’ll document each item in the weekly dashboard.

---

### 5) Invoicing & Terms
- **Invoicing:** Monthly (or weekly if you prefer), Net **7** days.  
- **Autopay** preferred (ACH or card).  
- **True-up:** Quarterly audit of revenue attribution & savings to reconcile any deltas (+/–) against the cap/tiers.

---

### 6) Caps, Floors, and Safeguards
- **Revenue share hard cap:** 5% per month.  
- **Seasonality clamp:** 0.75× to 1.25× ensures predictability.  
- **Pause/Exit:** 14-day out; we’ll hand over artifacts and access cleanly.

---

### 7) Scope Linkage
- This pricing covers the deliverables in **Scope** (dashboards, cadence, automation sprints, SOPs, hi

summary: How your weekly payments are calculated, seasonality adjustments, and quarterly true-ups.

> [!summary] TL;DR
> You pay **weekly** based on a monthly plan that includes: **Retainer** (seasonality-adjusted), **Tools**, **Revenue Share**, and a budgeted **Bonus**. Every quarter we **true-up** against actuals and rebalance the remaining weeks so cash flow stays smooth—no surprises.

## What’s included in your plan

1. **Retainer (base $1,000/mo)**  
   Adjusted for seasonality using your revenue pattern (busy months a bit higher, slower months lower).  
   Clamped between **0.75×–1.25×** of the base so it never swings too hard.

2. **Tools ($150/mo)**  
   Software and automation that supports delivery. This may change as stack evolves (we’ll note changes in the monthly plan).

3. **Performance share (baseline 3%)**  
   A share of **monthly revenue** (baseline **3%**; some scenarios model a **5% stretch** for planning). We use **actual revenue** at true-up time.

4. **Bonus for measurable savings/KPIs (budgeted at 15%)**  
   We budget **15% of estimated annual savings** as a yearly bonus pool and **spread it evenly across months by seasonality**. At quarterly true-ups, we reconcile to **actual savings/KPI wins**.

## Weekly smoothing

- We convert each **monthly total** into a **weekly amount** (defaults to 4.333 weeks/month) so payments are even.
- If a true-up says we collected too much, **future weeks go down**; if we under-collected, **future weeks go up**.

## Quarterly true-up (every 3 months)

1. Compare **Plan vs. Actuals** for Retainer (no change), Tools (actual), Revenue Share (actual % × actual revenue), Bonus (based on realized savings/KPIs).  
2. Compute the **Quarter Delta** (positive = you owe more; negative = credit).  
3. Spread that delta across **future months by seasonality** and add to weekly amounts (keeps cash-flow friendly).

## 18-month rolling window

- We plan on an **18-month horizon**. Each quarter, we rebalance the remaining weeks so the plan stays aligned with reality.

## Example numbers & spreadsheet

- See [[B-ROI-Payment-Projection-Example]] for a worked example.  
- We maintain a live spreadsheet (schedule + true-up). Ask us to share or embed it in your client hub.

## FAQs

**Do payments spike in busy months?**  
No—busy months **influence the plan**, but we smooth to weekly. True-ups use seasonality to distribute deltas gently.

**What if revenue drops?**  
Quarterly, the plan re-balances automatically. You’ll see smaller weekly amounts if actuals trail plan, and vice-versa.

**Can we cap the revenue share?**  
Yes, we can set a cap (e.g., 5%)—noted in your plan and applied in true-ups.

**Can we change the tool budget?**  
Yes, we’ll document stack changes and reflect them in the next cycle.
