If you grow, I grow â€” and Iâ€™m not just talking spiritually.  
This is a **retainer + percentage model** that keeps us both motivated to hit the next level.

## ðŸ’³ Payment Setup (Non-Negotiable)
- Payments are **weekly** via **autopay**.
- You must have:
  - **Primary**: Bank account on file  
  - **Backup**: Credit/debit card  
- If your account fails and your backup fails, service pauses. Period.

## ðŸ“ˆ Percentage of Gross Income
On top of your retainer:
- I receive a **2.0% of your gross revenue** for acting as your Virtual C-Suite.
- **Why gross, not net?** Because Iâ€™m here to help you grow, not get stuck in your expense drama.
- This percentage is based on an **estimated annual gross income** agreed upon at onboarding.

## ðŸ“Š Peak & Valley Payment Smoothing
Business is seasonal â€” I get it.  
- When youâ€™re slammed and revenueâ€™s up, payments **inflate** so I share in the busy grind.  
- When things slow down, payments **deflate** to ease the pressure on your cash flow.  
- Your **payment schedule** will reflect these natural cycles, so youâ€™re never overpaying in a drought or underpaying in a boom.
- This keeps us both sustainable, sane, and on the same side.

## ðŸ’¡ My ROI Promise
One of my primary goals:  
**The savings I bring + the costs I prevent should outweigh what you pay me.**  
That means:
- Iâ€™m not just paying for myself â€”  
- Iâ€™m actively putting *extra* back in your pocket.  
When you factor in avoided risks, increased efficiency, and profit growth, my work should feel less like an expense and more like a money-printing machine.

If at any point that balance tips the wrong way, we review, adjust, and fix it â€” fast.

## ðŸš« Late or Missed Payments
- **48-hour grace period** before work is paused.
- Late payments may incur a reactivation fee.
- Chronic late payers get a breakup letter.

**Bottom line:** This setup means when you win, I win.  
Iâ€™m not just clocking hours â€” Iâ€™m invested in your bottom line like itâ€™s my own.
