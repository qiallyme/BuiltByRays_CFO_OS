If you grow, I grow — and I’m not just talking spiritually.  
This is a **retainer + percentage model** that keeps us both motivated to hit the next level.

---

## 📌 Retainer + Billable Costs
- **Monthly Retainer**: Covers your core services, strategy, and availability.  
- **Billable Costs**: Any extra project work, special requests, or third-party expenses are billed weekly on top of the retainer.

---

## 💳 Payment Setup (Non-Negotiable)
- Payments are **weekly** via **autopay**.
- You must have:
  - **Primary**: Bank account on file  
  - **Backup**: Credit/debit card  
- If your account fails and your backup fails, service pauses. Period.

---

## 🛡️ The Buffer Deposit
- **One Month Retainer as Buffer**: This protects us both.
- Example: If your weekly is $250:
  - First payment = **$1,250**  
    - $1,000 = Non-refundable buffer deposit  
    - $250 = Your first week of service
- The buffer stays in place during our engagement.  
- If you cancel or ghost, that deposit covers the fallout — **non-refundable**.

---

## 📈 Percentage of Gross Income
On top of your retainer:
- I receive a **2.0% of your gross revenue** for acting as your Virtual C-Suite.
- **Why gross, not net?** Because I’m here to help you grow, not get stuck in your expense drama.
- This percentage is based on an **estimated annual gross income** agreed upon at onboarding.

---

## 🔍 Audit & Adjustment Process (Like Insurance, But Prettier)
1. **Estimate**  
   - We agree on an estimated annual gross at the start.  
   - Percentage is applied weekly to that estimate.
2. **Track**  
   - You provide ongoing access to revenue reports so I can keep an eye on trends.
3. **Audit**  
   - Quarterly or annually, we compare your *actual* gross to the estimate.
4. **True-Up**  
   - If you made more than projected → you owe the difference.  
   - If you made less than projected → you get a credit or reduced rate moving forward.

---

## 📊 Peak & Valley Payment Smoothing
Business is seasonal — I get it.  
- When you’re slammed and revenue’s up, payments **inflate** so I share in the busy grind.  
- When things slow down, payments **deflate** to ease the pressure on your cash flow.  
- Your **payment schedule** will reflect these natural cycles, so you’re never overpaying in a drought or underpaying in a boom.
- This keeps us both sustainable, sane, and on the same side.

---

## 🎯 Bonus Structure — How I Win When You Win
- Bonuses are triggered when you **hit or exceed growth targets** set in your KPIs.
- These are **stackable** — meaning the more targets you smash, the more I collect.
- Typical triggers:
  - **Revenue Milestones** — e.g., every $50k or $100k in *gross* revenue growth.
  - **Profit Margin Improvements** — when efficiency jumps and waste drops.
  - **Operational Wins** — like cutting your overdue A/R in half or slashing payroll leakage.
- Bonuses are calculated **quarterly** and billed separately from your weekly autopay.
- Think of it as my **"performance tip jar"** — except you already know I earned it.

---

## 💡 My ROI Promise
One of my primary goals:  
**The savings I bring + the costs I prevent should outweigh what you pay me.**  
That means:
- I’m not just paying for myself —  
- I’m actively putting *extra* back in your pocket.  
When you factor in avoided risks, increased efficiency, and profit growth, my work should feel less like an expense and more like a money-printing machine.

If at any point that balance tips the wrong way, we review, adjust, and fix it — fast.

---

## 🕒 Payment Schedule
- Autopay runs every Monday.
- Bills for billable costs are added to that week’s payment.
- No pay, no play — I don’t start work without a clear runway.

---

## 🚫 Late or Missed Payments
- **48-hour grace period** before work is paused.
- Late payments may incur a reactivation fee.
- Chronic late payers get a breakup letter.

---

**Bottom line:** This setup means when you win, I win.  
I’m not just clocking hours — I’m invested in your bottom line like it’s my own.
