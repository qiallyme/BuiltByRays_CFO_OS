Partnership means **you’re just as invested in the outcome as I am**. Here’s how you hold up your side:

- **Be Available.**  
  Show up to meetings, answer messages, and respond when I need input. Silence stalls the project.

- **Be Honest.**  
  If something’s wrong, say it. If you’re stuck, admit it. If you’re thrilled, share that too. I’m not psychic — yet.

- **Stick to Agreements.**  
  We set timelines, scopes, and priorities for a reason. Constant changes cost time and money.

- **Pay On Time.**  
  No excuses. This is a business relationship, not a “when I can get to it” arrangement.

- **Trust the Process.**  
  You hired me for my expertise — let me use it. Second-guessing every move slows us both down.

- **Respect Boundaries.**  
  I keep clear office hours and realistic response times so I can deliver my best work.

- **Bring Decisions, Not Drama.**  
  Problems are fine. Drama isn’t.

- **Stay Engaged.**  
  Even when the work is running smoothly in the background, stay connected. Quiet doesn’t mean nothing’s happening.

**Bottom line:** You get the best results when you treat this as a collaboration, not a transaction.
