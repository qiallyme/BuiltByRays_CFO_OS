## Company-Wide Goals  
These are the big-picture wins we chase together — the stuff that actually moves the needle:  

1. **Revenue Growth** – We keep that chart pointing up.  
2. **Profitability** – Growth is cute, but profit is king. We don’t blow money just to look busy.  
3. **Operational Efficiency** – Less wasted time, less wasted effort, more results.  
4. **Customer Experience** – Happy customers = repeat customers = more revenue.  
5. **Brand Presence** – People know your name and trust it.  
6. **Innovation** – We keep things fresh, competitive, and impossible to ignore.

## My Personal KPIs (a.k.a. The Bonus Triggers)  
Here’s what *I* have to hit to earn my bonuses (full details in the **Investment** section):  

1. **Strategic Milestone Delivery** – Big projects, rolled out on time and done right.  
2. **Revenue Impact** – If I help make you more money or save you a chunk of it, I’m on track.  
3. **System Implementation** – New systems or processes that stick and make life easier.  
4. **KPI Health** – The company-wide KPIs keep trending up without burning out the team.  
5. **Special Initiatives** – Those extra-credit wins that go above and beyond the roadmap.

### Real Talk:  
If you grow, I grow.  
My bonus isn’t magic — it comes from **making you more money, saving you money, or delivering wins that last**.  
We’re not clock-watchers here — we measure progress, momentum, and results that matter.
