## Company-Wide Goals  
These are the big-picture wins we chase together — the stuff that actually moves the needle:  

1. **Revenue Growth** – We keep that chart pointing up.  
2. **Profitability** – Growth is cute, but profit is king. We don’t blow money just to look busy.  
3. **Operational Efficiency** – Less wasted time, less wasted effort, more results.  
4. **Customer Experience** – Happy customers = repeat customers = more revenue.  
5. **Brand Presence** – People know your name and trust it.  
6. **Innovation** – We keep things fresh, competitive, and impossible to ignore.  

## Core KPIs (example set)
- **Revenue:** MRR/Bookings, Win rate, CAC payback  
- **Margin:** Gross margin %, Contribution per product/job  
- **Cash:** Runway, Collections cycle, Burn multipliers  
- **Ops:** Cycle time, Throughput, Defect/return rates  
- **People:** Hiring funnel, Ramp time, Retention

## Reporting
- **Weekly:** KPI snapshot + “what changed” notes  
- **Monthly:** Trend lines + variances vs plan  
- **Quarterly:** Strategy review, re-baseline goals

### Real Talk:  
If you grow, I grow.  
My bonus isn’t magic — it comes from **making you more money, saving you money, or delivering wins that last**.  
We’re not clock-watchers here — we measure progress, momentum, and results that matter.
