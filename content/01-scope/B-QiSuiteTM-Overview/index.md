**QiSuite™** is a fractional **C-Suite operating system**: one partner aligning finance, operations, technology, and growth so the business moves as a single organism.

## The Pillars
- **Clarity:** simple dashboards, clean docs, and decisions made on signal—not noise.  
- **Velocity:** short sprints, fast MVPs, continuous iteration.  
- **Control:** mapped roles, crisp SOPs, and automation where it counts.  
- **Proof:** weekly artifacts and live KPIs so progress is visible.

## How We Work
1. **Kickoff & Audit (Week 1):** reality check across finance, ops, tech.  
2. **MVP Launch (Week 2):** core systems live + quick wins shipped.  
3. **Sprints (Weeks 3–6):** upgrades, training, and handoffs.  
4. **Scale Phase (Optional):** permanent hires, expanded stack, or keep Q fractional.

## What You Get
- A **decision-ready** operation—no more guessing.  
- Systems that **survive success** (and auditors).  
- Less chaos, more margin, faster growth.
