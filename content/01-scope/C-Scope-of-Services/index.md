## Overview
QiSuite™ is your Fractional C‑Suite — a high‑impact, multi‑discipline partner embedded in your business to strengthen leadership, streamline operations, and drive growth.

I operate across finance, operations, technology, marketing, and strategy — with a clear scope, agreed boundaries, and measurable results.

## Engagement Boundaries

- I **don’t** replace your entire team — I enhance it.  
- I **don’t** take orders without strategy — I advise and act based on business goals.  
- I **don’t** handle legal representation — I can connect you to trusted attorneys.  

## Client Responsibilities
- Provide timely information, approvals, and access.  
- Follow agreed communication and escalation channels.  
- Maintain a decision‑maker available for approvals.  
- Respect working boundaries and availability limits.  

---

## Engagement Cycle
- **Week Kickoff** – Align priorities and confirm deliverables.  
- **Sprint Cycles** – Execute in focused, measurable phases.  
- **Review & Adjust** – Refine based on data and outcomes.  
- **Transition & Offboarding** – Full handover if/when engagement ends.
