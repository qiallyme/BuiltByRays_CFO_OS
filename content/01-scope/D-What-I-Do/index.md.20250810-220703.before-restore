## **1 – What I Do**
I’m your **fractional C-Suite powerhouse** — CFO, COO, CIO, and fixer rolled into one.  
My job? To get your business running smoother, making more money, and feeling less like a dumpster fire.

Here’s how I make it happen:

- **Accounting & Tax – Done Right**  
  Clean books, organized receipts, airtight reporting, and tax filings that won’t give your CPA heart palpitations.

- **AI & Automation Everywhere**  
  If it can be automated, I’ll make it happen. From repetitive admin work to client onboarding, we cut wasted time and human error.

- **Fast MVP → Long-Term Growth**  
  We can launch something in weeks, not months, then refine and scale without losing momentum.

- **Fractional C-Suite Partnership**  
  Strategy, leadership, and execution without the six-figure salary hit. I bring the experience, you keep the equity.

- **Full Operational Overhaul**  
  From SOPs to staff roles, we’ll streamline and reorganize so the business runs like it should — without you doing everything.

- **IT & Infrastructure**  
  Tech audits, system upgrades, security protocols — you’ll finally know what you own, how it works, and that it’s not bleeding money.

- **Real-Time Command Center**  
  Dashboards, live reporting, and key metrics in one place so you can make decisions without guessing.

**Bottom line:** I don’t just give advice — I build the systems, implement the tools, and make sure they work in the real world.
